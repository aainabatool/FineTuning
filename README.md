#Fine-Tuning DistilBERT on the Emotion Dataset

This project fine-tunes DistilBERT
 on the Emotion dataset
 to classify text into six emotions: anger, joy, sadness, fear, love, and surprise.

It demonstrates how to:  

1. Load and preprocess data with ðŸ¤—  Datasets
2. Tokenize text for DistilBERT
3. Fine-tune with ðŸ¤— Trainer API
4. Evaluate with Accuracy & F1-macro
5. Compare base vs fine-tuned model
6. Visualize results with a confusion matrix
7. mRun inference with test examples
